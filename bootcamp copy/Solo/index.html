          <h1>Who Is Kevin Gates</h1>
        <p> <span class='emp'> It is the easiest and cheapest mode of communication. Through the Internet, 
            business owners and employees can connect to customers and other members of 
            the community easier than any other medium. Instead of having to call or visit 
            the store to obtain information about its products or services, customers can 
            email the store to get an answer. It helps in creating large sales and increase 
            the overall business. Many consumers prefer shopping online because of its ease 
            and convenience; they can shop when they want, with no lines and with no visiting 
            the store in person. Online stores are also ideal for consumers who dont live 
            within a reasonable distance from a store.</span></p>

        <h1>Why Is He The Best</h1>    
        <p> Some level of human touch is removed in such business which can be seen as a 
            hurdle for adding new consumers. Some of the correspondence between customers 
            and businesses can become impersonal. Prior to the Internet, a customer with a 
            complaint could contact the store manager and voice her concern in person. When 
            this person now voices her concern through an email, she may receive a form 
            letter back, which doesn't give her the satisfaction of dealing with a human.
            Data is prone to be stolen or hacked in some form. This is a major issue where 
            instead of real customers bots are designated who try to break into your online 
            business. It increases the vulnerability of the data.</p>
